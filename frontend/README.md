# RedFlag Frontend

The RedFlag frontend is a Next.js 16 App Router experience that surfaces Sui smart-contract risk intelligence generated by our multi-agent LLM pipeline. It consumes the Express API exposed from `backend/` and renders dashboards, analysis reports, and monitoring views.

## Requirements

- Node.js 20+
- Yarn Classic (workspace aware)
- A running backend instance with CORS configured for the frontend origin

## Environment

Create `frontend/.env.local` based on `.env.example`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` | Base URL for API requests (e.g., `http://localhost:3001`). |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` | The public URL of the frontend. Used to generate OpenGraph/Twitter card metadata. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVY_APP_ID` | Optional Privy app id if authentication is enabled. |

## Develop

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev:frontend
```

This serves the app on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with hot reloading.

## Branding & Meta

- Browser favicon uses `tab-logo.png` from `frontend/images`.
- Social preview cards reference `Light mode horizontal.png` for WhatsApp, Twitter/X, and other link unfurlers.
- A persistent footer and navigation link point to the public repository so visitors can follow development.
